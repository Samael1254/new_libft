# **Personnal libft of gfulconi for the 42 cursus**

**This libft is composed of many functions divided in several categories :**
- Characters
- Strings
- Math
- Memory management
- Sorts
- Linked lists
- Hashtables

**And standalone functions of larger size :**
- Get Next Line
- Printf and Dprintf

**Will be added in the future :**
- _WIP_ : Algebra (vectors and matrixes) category
- More hashtable functions
- F, g, G conversions for printf in that order

**Known issues :**
- In printf, some double parameters appear badly rounded
- Get_next_line is slow because of malloc for each character
