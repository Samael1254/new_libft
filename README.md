# **Personnal libft of gfulconi for the 42 cursus**

**This libft is composed of many functions divided in several categories :**
- Characters
- Strings
- Math
- Memory management
- Sorts
- Linked lists
- Hashtables (WIP)

**And standalone functions of larger size :**
- Get Next Line
- Printf and Dprintf

**Will be added in the future :**
- more hashtable functions
- F, g, G, a, A conversions for printf in that order

**Known issues :**
- The hashtable resize function segfaults
- In printf, some double parameters appear badly rounded
